The exercise is based on dependency analysis, a useful process for evaluating the complexity and inter-connectedness of source code. For simplicity, simple tokens are used instead of class names.
The Exercise Write some code that determines the full set of transitive dependencies for a group of items. The code takes as input a set of lines where the first token is the name of an item. The remaining tokens are the names of things that this first item depends on. Given the following input, we know that A directly depends on B and C, B depends on C and E, and so on.

A B C
B C E
C G
D A F
E F
F H

The program should use this data to calculate the full set of dependencies.
The output of the program for the above input should look like:

A B C E F G H
B C E F G H
C G
D A B C E F G H
E F H
F H

Optional extra
Extend your program so that it can also be used to calculate inverse dependencies

Run the Project:

1. Run the Java Class: TransitiveDependencies
Default Input: 
A B C
B C E
C G
D A F
E F
F H

Output:
{A=[B, C, E, F, G, H], B=[C, E, F, G, H], C=[G], D=[A, B, C, E, F, G, H], E=[F, H], F=[H]}
